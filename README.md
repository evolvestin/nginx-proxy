# Nginx Proxy Manager Setup

## Overview
This project provides a Dockerized deployment of **Nginx Proxy Manager**. It serves as a user-friendly, web-based interface for managing Nginx reverse proxy hosts.

Instead of manually editing Nginx configuration files, this setup allows you to easily expose your internal Docker services to the internet, manage domains, and handle free SSL certificates (via Let's Encrypt) through a graphical dashboard.

## Purpose & Features
The primary purpose of this stack is to act as the **Main Gateway/Ingress** for your server.

*   **Reverse Proxy:** Routes incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet to specific internal Docker containers or IP addresses.
*   **SSL Management:** Automatically obtains, renews, and manages SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.
*   **Access Control:** Provides options for Basic Auth and access lists to secure private services.
*   **GUI Management:** All configurations are done via a web browser on port `81`, eliminating the need for terminal-based Nginx config editing.
*   **Shared Network:** Uses a dedicated external Docker network (`web-proxy-net`) to communicate securely with other containers without exposing their ports to the host machine.

## Prerequisites
*   Docker
*   Docker Compose
*   **Important:** You must create the external network before starting this container.

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Create the External Network
Since the `docker-compose.yml` defines `web-proxy-net` as external, you must create it manually first. This allows other independently running containers to attach to this proxy.

```bash
docker network create web-proxy-net
```

### 2. Start the Service
Run the following command in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuration Details

### Ports
| Port | Purpose | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **80** | HTTP | Incoming standard web traffic. |
| **443** | HTTPS | Incoming secure web traffic. |
| **81** | Admin UI | The web interface for managing the proxy. |

### Volumes (Persistence)
The configuration ensures that your data survives container restarts:
*   `./data`: Stores the internal database (SQLite) and Nginx configuration files.
*   `./letsencrypt`: Stores the SSL certificates generated by Let's Encrypt.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

`http://<your-server-ip>:81`

### Default Credentials
On the first login, use the standard default credentials:

*   **Email:** `admin@example.com`
*   **Password:** `changeme`

*Note: You will be prompted to change these credentials immediately after logging in.*

## How to Connect Other Services
To proxy other Docker containers through this instance, add them to the `web-proxy-net` network in their respective `docker-compose.yml` files.

**Example for another service:**
```yaml
services:
  my-web-app:
    image: nginx:alpine
    networks:
      - web-proxy-net

networks:
  web-proxy-net:
    external: true
```
In the Nginx Proxy Manager UI, you can then forward traffic to `my-web-app` (using the container name as the hostname) on port `80`.
